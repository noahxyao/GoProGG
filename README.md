# Riot Games API

Things to keep in mind when new patches release:

* champion.json was pulled from DDragon online and needs to be updated
* item.json was pulled from DDragon online and needs to be updated
* Square Assets are pulled from LeagueWiki (but could also be pulled from DDragon) and might need to be updated


Further Things to be done:

* Integrate DB for faster processing, also being independent from Riot API limits
* Look into setting up virtualenv or Pipenv to get a cleaner requirements.txt
* Add tabs for champ mastery, etc
* Add More interesting stats: 
	-DMG% in Team
	-DMG/Min Difference?
	-CS Difference @ 15 Min
	-FB Rate
    -Champion Mastery in Ranked
